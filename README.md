# Landmark Articles

I've read tons of blog posts and articles about personal and professional development, but occasionally, maybe once or twice a year, I'd read one that profoundly impacts me. In these moments I think, "**I have to save this somewhere... I don't ever want to forget it**."

At first I saved them to a folder on my hard drive named "Landmark Articles." Later, I moved them to Evernote. But why keep them secret? If they're so valuable to me, then I should just make the list public so others can benefit from them as well.

## The List

**[See the List Here: Landmark Articles](http://bryanbraun.github.io/landmark-articles)**

The list is maintained in index.html, and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Fork this Repo

You can keep track of the articles that have impacted you by forking this repo and updating it with your own articles. It's probably a good thing for everybody to have a list like this.

## Contributing

If you've got an article that has been a strong influence on your personal/professional development as a web developer, then I want to know about it! Open an issue, drop in the link, and I'll be very grateful. My only rules are:

* No links to videos, presentation slides, podcasts, etc.
* Don't submit your own articles.

I'll read everything submitted and if it sticks in my brain and just won't go away, I'll add it to the list.

## Thanks

* Peter Cooper
