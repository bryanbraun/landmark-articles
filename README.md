# Landmark Articles

I've read thousands of online blog posts and articles about web development, but occasionally, maybe once or twice a year, I'd read one so inspiring that I'd think, "**I have to save this somewhere... I don't ever want to forget it**."

At first I saved them to a folder on my hard drive named "Landmark Articles." Later, I moved them to Evernote. But why keep them secret? If they're so valuable to me, then I should just make the list public so others can benefit from them as well.

## The List

**[See the List Here: Landmark Articles](http://bryanbraun.github.io/landmark-articles)**

The list is maintained in index.html.

## Contributions

If you've got an article that has been a strong influence on your personal/professional development as a web developer, then I want to know about it! Open an issue, drop in the link, and I'll be very grateful. My only rules are:

* No links to videos, presentation slides, podcasts, etc.
* Don't submit your own articles.

I'll read everything submitted, but I'm not going to add articles willy-nilly. This list is only for those that really impact me... the ones I'll go back to again and again. It's selective and it's personal.

If you feel like the list isn't complete enough for you, then fork it and maintain your own. It's probably a good thing for everybody to have a list like this.

## Thanks
